# Machine-Learning
This repository is a collection of my hands-on projects and experiments as I learn machine learning concepts. My focus is on understanding the **mathematics** and **implementation details** behind popular machine learning algorithms. By coding these algorithms from scratch, I aim to gain a deeper understanding of how they work under the hood.
